    'ab2'=>"I graduated BIL-Aktobe in 2019. Since my studies in BIL, I've been interested interested in IT. I think that, in the future, we will all need to know at least one coding language. Coding, in the simplest of terms, is telling a computer what you want it to do, which involves typing in step-by-step commands for the computer to follow. Learning to code has been likened to learning a foreign language, or perhaps more specifically a family of foreign languages.",
